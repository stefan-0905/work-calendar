# work-calendar
Application that counts work days in month and calculates the salary

I build this app so I could easily count free and work days in current month and calculate salary. On this job there were 3 shifts(1<sup>st</sup>,3<sup>rd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>). After 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> shift there are 2 days off and after 2<sup>nd</sup> there is 1.

Using Vanilla JavaScript i took current month, created calendar and then added classes to mark work days, after which i calculated salary.
